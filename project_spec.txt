Lost & Found Management System – An Example

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: Lost & Found Management System for College Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

The Lost & Found Management System is a web-based application designed to help students and staff report lost items and return found items within a college campus using a centralized digital platform.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In a college campus, students often lose personal items such as ID cards, books, wallets, mobile phones, and accessories. The existing system depends on notice boards or word-of-mouth communication, which is inefficient and unreliable. There is no proper tracking system to verify ownership or monitor the status of lost and found items.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

A web application where users can report lost items and upload details of found items. Users can search and filter items based on category, date, and location. The Admin verifies items and updates the status (Lost → Found → Returned). This ensures transparency, faster recovery, and proper record maintenance.
